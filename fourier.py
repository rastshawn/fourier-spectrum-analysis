# ideas
# use standard deviations to see how many peaks there are?
# use a lookup table to figure out pitch
# pass in sound file from command line arg
# use with recordings - instead of passing by 1-second chunks, pass instead by a rolling one-second chunk of frames
# make fft work with frame counts that are not a power of 2, or alternatively a 1-second rolling chunk to skip the problem entirely
# make sharp or flat from pitches, instead of just sharp
# cluster similar pitches so duplicate results aren't added. Use weighted averages to figure out what the pitch was
